						The next important part of scrum are product and sprint backlog
						A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first.
						The sprint backlog is a list of the most important tasks of the product backlog. This is a list of optimization tasks that the team will perform in the next sprint.

						Before considering the stages of work in scrum let's define sprint. Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review.
						Sprint can be as short as a few days and generally are no longer than 3 – 4 weeks. The main goal of the sprint is the implememntation product

						Sprint retrospective
						The retrospective is where the team comes together to discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint or even for certain ceremonies.
 						The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.
