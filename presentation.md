# Scrum

## Slide 1
First of all, define the term "scrum".
### What is scrum???
According to official documentation
a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

## Slide 2
### Where the scrum is used???
I think it will be useful to know where it is used:

## Slide 3
#### Scrum has been used extensively to:
0. Research and identify technologies, and product capabilities
0. Develop products and enhancements;
0. Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day
0. Sustain and renew products.

## Slide 4
### Which companies use scrum in their work?
Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, IBM, Philips, BBC and many others

# Slide 5
### How can it be used in the workflow?
In order use scrumin the workflow you need to learn the basic rules?

# Slide 6
The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts. Let's consider each of them

# Slide 7
First, team roles: scrum master, product owner, dev team. The recommended Development Team size in Scrum is from 3 to 9 members which do not include the Scrum Master and the Product Owner. Let’s focus on each role in detail.

# Slide 8
Scrum Master is the person who is responsible for coaching the Development Team. the Product Owner is the one who ensures that the team understands the Scrum Values and Principles and is able to practice them. Scrum master also helps and supports the team to become self-organized.

# Slide 9
Next, product Owner is the voice of the customer and hence is responsible for bridging the gap between the development team and stakeholders. The product owner is also responsible for choosing what should be included into a project.

# Slide 10
Another very important part of the Scrum Team is the Development Team. The Development Team is consist of developers proficient in their own area.

# Slide 11
The next important part of scrum is artifacts: product and sprint backlog. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. 
* The sprint backlog is a list of the most important tasks of the product backlog. This is a list of optimization tasks that the team will perform in the next sprint.

# Slide 12
Before considering the stages of work in scrum let's define sprint.
Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. Sprint can be as short as a few days and generally are no longer than 3 – 4 weeks.

# Slide 13
### How use scrum?
The first thing you need to create product backlog of your project. After that, you can start sprint.

# Slide 14
Sprint includes: sprint planning, daily meeting, sprint review, sprint retrospective.

# Slide 15
### Sprint planning
This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal. Specific use stories are added to the sprint from the product backlog. At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint.

# Slide 16
### Daily meeting
This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually mornings) and place. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes, but that’s just a guideline. This meeting is also called a ‘daily stand-up’ emphasizing that it needs to be a quick one. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.

# Slide 17
### Sprint review
At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now ‘Done’ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment, although in most cases the increment is released.

# Slide 18
### Sprint retrospective
The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.

# Slide 19
### Advantage of scrum 
In conclusion, highlight the following advantages of using scrum
* Fast
* Lightweight
* The cost of managing is inexpensive
* Helps in improving the product quality
* Team members can be creative and get to know all the modules of the project
